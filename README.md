Pokemon themed e-commerce web application. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can scroll through the page and add items to their cart. The cart feature 
takes in quantity and price of items and totals the sum at the bottom of the modal. Users can also remove items from their carts.

This application is a big update from the original version. The original version had way more animations in it. As I looked through other e-commerce sites for layout inspiration, I noticed that a lot of them just had their products on screen without any distracting CSS tricks. From a user standpoint, I realized that I also didn't like it when e-commerce websites had too many animations running in the background. I preferred just to look at a picture of a product, the price, and the description. I cleaned up the design, made the layout more user friendly, and added little disclaimers at the footer to make the site seem more "real".
